A lorenz attractor visualization written using the [nannou framework](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou) ([nannou.cc](https://nannou.cc/)) in rust inspired by [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0lkz2gSsIk), and rendered in 2D with an implementation of perspective projection. 
## build & run
